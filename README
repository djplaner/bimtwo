*Deadline*

Intent is to have working version of bim2 up and going by
31 Jan 2011.  Hopefully before then.

Obviously that deadline has passed and delivery has not been
forthcoming.  Let's add a month to that deadline and see how
we go, hopefully that's a deadline I can meet, but no promises.

*About*

bim2 is an update of the BIM activity module for Moodle 1.9.x.
It's being re-written to work with Moodle v2.0 and also to 
make some imporvements.

_About the name_

As well as porting bim to Moodle 2.0, bim2 is also meant to 
be a major re-design of bim.  Hence the desire to make a
distinction between the two versions by change the name.

bim2 is a sensible name, however, it doesn't work within
Moodle where module names aren't supposed to contain digits
like 2. 

Current solution is to talk about bim2 but within Moodle
the proper name will be bimtwo.
